              <p class="text-faded mb-4">Hello! Welcome to my profile, my name is Hasan. I have a degree in Computer Science from the New Jersey Institute of Technology, and work professionally as a software engineer. I have worked in the past in various technical positions ranging from general IT, to web development, to data analytics. I have a variety of interests, such as computer hardware, stock and derivative trading, and data engineering.</p>

              <h3 class="mb-3">Quantative Stock Selection</h3>
              <p class="text-muted mb-0">I did research with the Ying Wu College of Computing here at NJIT. Specifically, I created a project that looked into quantitatively making investment decisions. I created a backtest engine that would allow me to test strategies that were both long and short on equities. I implemented strategies (mostly moving average based) that analyzed market data to make trading decisions. This was entirely done using paper trading and no actual money was traded, but some of the variations were able to beat the market.</p>

              <h3 class="mb-3">Algorithmic Cryptocurrency Trading</h3>
              <p class="text-muted mb-0">I created a cryptocurrency trading system that I actually let trade money. Although it was a small amount, less than $5 at the time of writing, this algorithm was surprisingly able to overcome commissions and generate a small profit. This algorithm gathers data from both REST and Websocket APIs provided by the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, analyzes that data and makes trading decisions accordingly. I chose to do this project in Python because of the rapid development time (prototype was built over a weekend), but am looking into rewriting some parts in C/C++ to make it faster. Currently there is a market data tool and order execution tool I wrote that only targets Coinbase, but I am looking into expanding those to include other exchanges if arbitrage opportunities present themselves.</p>

              <h3 class="mb-3">Makerspace Access Control System</h3>
              <p class="text-muted mb-0">I worked on a team that created an access control system for the NJIT Makerspace. This system allows users into the makerspace and lets users use machines, utilizing HID cards for identification. I was responsible for the creating and maintaining the database (MySQL/MariaDB), a REST API backend framework (NodeJS/Express), and some basic business intelligence infrastructure. All of this was running on Linux (RHEL) machines so once in a while there was scripting involved to automate tasks.</p>
